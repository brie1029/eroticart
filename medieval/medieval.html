      <h1>Erotic Art in Medieval Europe</h1>
      <p>
        All works featured are from Martha Easton’s
        <em
          >“Was It Good For You, Too?” Medieval Erotic Art and Its Audience</em
        >
        (2008). There is a common misconception that medieval Christianity
        refrained from sexual content and were prudish, but when looking through
        the texts and literature, it is clear to see the medieval people’s
        interest in sex (Easton, 2008). Easton examines the following images and
        narrates why they could have been experienced as erotic (2008). As
        devotion to Christ grew, images and writings of the beloved providing
        orgasmic pleasure and penetrative sensations to his servants followed
        (Easton, 2008).

        The nakedness of women and the temptation motifs rose from the story of
        the Fall of Adam and Eve (Easton, 2008). The pictures of breasts came to
        represent “motherhood, femininity, and erotic longing” (Easton, 2008, p.
        6). Images of bodies began to disappear after the 13th and 14th
        centuries due to a desire to make social control of the body stricter
        and more private (Easton, 2008). This even stretched as far as oral
        readings became silent and public content made private which in turn led
        to even more interest in erotic art and writing (Easton, 2008).
