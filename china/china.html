      <h1>Erotic Art in China: 1800-1920</h1>
      <p>
        All works featured are from John Byron’s
        <em
          >Portrait of a Chinese Paradise: Erotica and Sexual Customs of the
          Late Qing Period</em
        >
        (1987). The pieces contain similar characteristics as well as draw from
        the past and foreign influences relevant at the time (Byron, 1987). Late
        Qing dynasty erotica uses humor and the political environment and
        highlight supposedly suppressed sexuality (Byron, 1987). The
        Confucianism which paints China as moralistic, impersonal, and humorless
        was pushed by political dynamics and removed the colorful and diverse
        nature of the Chinese people (Byron, 1987). Underneath the ‘Confucian
        mask’ lies a people invested in sexual pleasure and who’s erotic artwork
        lacks sadistic influences and depicts mutually interested participants
        (Byron, 1987).

        The rise in popularity of snuff in the 18th century led to the creation
        of luxurious bottles and memorabilia (Byron, 1987). This showed up in
        the form of erotic snuff bottles and medicine bottles, some of which are
        hard to distinguish between due to the mass amounts made and used
        (Byron, 1987). Snuff bottles were made for the gentlemen that would
        visit brothels and would even match them to their outfits (Byron, 1987).
        Homosexual brothels were popular in Beijing and was tied into the opera
        culture (Byron, 1987). Homosexuality is found in some erotic pieces and
        seems to have been reserved to royalty, wealthy, and theatre acts but
        does not seem to have been socially condemned (Byron, 1987).
